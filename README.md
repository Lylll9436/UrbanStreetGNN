## üåê Project Overview

This project explores the quantification of street value in urban contexts by integrating **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** into urban design workflows. Through structured data pipelines, spatial graph construction, and machine learning techniques, the project enables an objective and scalable evaluation of urban street segments.

## üìç Key Modules

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Road network (OSM)
   - POI and building footprint data

2. **Preprocessing & Graph Construction**
   - Road merging & segment extraction
   - Building grouping, node-edge graph conversion
   - Label assignment

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Edge: metric-based and visual (street view image)
   - Node: POI embedding, topological features

4. **Model Training**
   - Graph classification & link prediction using GNNs (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE)

5. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**
